# Thoughts on problem solving

### Please note that the scope of this discussion is only Vietnam.

## Why are companies asking problem solving questions ?

Nowadays it seems every companies are asking problem solving question in interview. For example finding the most number of task can be done in a day given the starting time and ending time, ways to combine coins for 1 million or something like that. And the higher the company pays, the tougher the question get. It's not just solving algorithmic problems, it can also be some variants of real world problem like sorting an extremely large file that can't be fit into the main memory. But it seems that not everyone like these types of interview question. Go on tamsudev, a Vietnamese developers ranting site, you can find comments like these on many companies.

For me, this is a very crooked way of looking into this. There is a reason why companies are asking these questions. IMHO, a good software engineer is a good problem solver, who can make use of the various tools given to him/her to solve tough and challenging problems. For an interview of 1 hour or so, I think an good algorithmic question can reveal alot about the way someone tackle a new challenging problem. Why is that ? Because in the span of one hour, the candidate will have to take multiple steps, which I think are the foundation to being a good software engineer, to solve the problem. The first step is the analysis of the problem. This is the most important parts to solving any problem in my opinion. For any given problem, if you can analyze and break it down into smaller and familiar enough problems, they can all be solve. Then the next step is coming up with a solution to each of those smaller problems, it doesn't have to optimized right away, just a brute force solution is good enough drafting. Then you need to ask yourself, is this good enough ? Try to remove those redundant loops, if else clause, try to think of a way to reduce it from a nasty O(n^2) to just O(nlogn) or better yet O(n). Then comes the testing, write a few simple test cases to see if your code pass, try to think of some weird conner case. And that's it, that's my process to solving any problems in general. For me, a good interview algorithmic problem is a one that doesn't have any advace algorithms needed to solve them, because not everyone is a competitive programmer. For example I consider this an extremely good problem for interviews: [Codeforces Educational Round 52 - C. Make It Equal

Next let's move on to how can you train your problem solving skills.

## How to become better at problem solving ?
This is the part where most people confused algorithmic problem solving with learning the theory behind algorithms. People always assume that an Informatics Olympiad winner will know how to implement quick sort, red-black tree and stuffs like that. I don't know about others competitve programmers, but for me I have never implemented quick sort in my life. Sure I know about quick sort property like it is based on divide and conquer, its runtime complexity is usually O(nlogn) and so on. But I have never implemented. But I know how to break down a problem to smaller and more familiar problems so that I can solve one of those smaller problems with just a simple sort call. And this is, IMO, the biggest benefit to solving algorithmic problems. It teaches you how to approach a problem systematically, breaking it down, and solving it piece by piece. This is also a great skill in the industry. Of course, solving algorithmic problems is not the only way to train your problem solving skill, this is just the way that I am most familiar with. Even now after I have achieved some small prizes in competitve programming, I still go on codeforces to solve problems every now and then because I enjoy doing it very much. It's fun and stimulating. So how should you start learning to solve algorithmic problems. From my personal experience, I would recommend reading the [Competitive Programmer's Handbook
](https://cses.fi/book/index.html), a great introduction to the world of algorithmic problems solving. As you read each chapter, try to find problems related to the content of that chapter on Online Judging site like Codeforces, Atcoder, SPOJ and so on. My personal favorite is Codeforces as it allows you to view the wrong test case, which helps alot with the debugging process. First start small by solving problems from Div3, Div2, then grinds your way to Div1.
